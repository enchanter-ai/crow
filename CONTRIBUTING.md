## Stack

bash + jq only for hooks. No Node.js. No external APIs.
Python stdlib is OK for non-time-critical scripts (report generation, learnings).

## Critical Rules

Before submitting a PR, verify:

1. **Never use `flock`** — macOS doesn't have it. Use atomic `mkdir` for locks.
2. **Never use `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`** for cache keys — doesn't reset after /clear.
3. **Never use `jq -s`** on growing files — slurps entire file into RAM. Safe on bounded inputs (`tail -n 20` output).
4. **Every hook has `trap 'exit 0' ERR INT TERM`** — hooks must never break Claude.
5. **64KB stdout limit** — write large output to tmpfiles under `/tmp/crow-*`.
6. **Validate JSON before parsing** with `jq empty`.
7. **Block URL-encoded path traversal** — decode `%2e%2e` before checking.
8. **Rotation at 10MB** not 1MB.
9. **Use `jq -n --arg`** for JSON construction — never printf/sed chains.

## Code Style

- `shellcheck -x` passes on all `.sh` files
- Use `printf "%s"` over `echo` for variable content
- Use `local` for function variables
- Quote all variable expansions (`"$var"` not `$var`)
- Use `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for conditionals
- Use `$(command)` over backticks
- Keep hook scripts under 200 lines
- One responsibility per hook script

## Testing

```bash
bash tests/run-all.sh
```

Each test pipes mock JSON to hooks via stdin and verifies exit codes and output.
Tests must clean up all temp files and state files after running.

## Architecture

Each plugin owns a specific concern across hook lifecycle phases:

```
PostToolUse  →  change-tracker   (V1: semantic diff compression)
PostToolUse  →  trust-scorer     (V2: Bayesian trust scoring)
PostToolUse  →  decision-gate    (V3: info-gain ordering, V5: adversarial review)
PreCompact   →  session-memory   (V4: continuity graph, V6: Exponential Strategy Averaging)
```

Plugins communicate only through filesystem state. No direct function calls.

## Adding a Plugin

Create the following structure:

```
plugins/<name>/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json      # name, description, version, author, license, keywords, skills, agents
├── skills/<skill>/SKILL.md         # allowed-tools frontmatter, instructions
├── agents/<agent>.md               # model, context: fork, allowed-tools, instructions
├── commands/<command>.md           # slash commands
├── hooks/
│   ├── hooks.json                  # lifecycle bindings
│   └── <hook-point>/<script>.sh    # hook scripts
├── state/.gitkeep                  # runtime state
└── README.md                       # plugin-level documentation
```

Register the plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

### plugin.json template

```json
{
  "name": "crow-<plugin-name>",
  "description": "<one-line description>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "enchanter-ai" },
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["<relevant>", "<keywords>"],
  "commands": ["./commands/<cmd>.md"],
  "skills": ["./skills/<skill>/"],
  "agents": "./agents/"
}
```

## Adding a Hook

1. Create the script in `plugins/<plugin>/hooks/<hook-point>/<name>.sh`
2. Add the binding in `plugins/<plugin>/hooks/hooks.json`
3. Start with:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   trap 'exit 0' ERR INT TERM
   set -uo pipefail
   ```
4. Source shared utilities:
   ```bash
   PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)}"
   SHARED_DIR="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../shared"
   source "${SHARED_DIR}/constants.sh"
   source "${SHARED_DIR}/sanitize.sh"
   source "${SHARED_DIR}/metrics.sh"
   ```
5. Read stdin JSON, validate, extract fields
6. Always exit 0 on errors
7. Add a test in `tests/<plugin>/test-<name>.sh`

## Adding a Skill

1. Create `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
2. Add `allowed-tools` frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <skill-name>
   description: >
     When to trigger. What it does.
   allowed-tools:
     - Read
     - Bash
   ---
   ```
3. Register in `plugin.json` under `skills`

## Adding an Agent

1. Create `plugins/<plugin>/agents/<agent>.md`
2. Required frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: crow-<agent>
   model: haiku
   context: fork
   allowed-tools:
     - Read
     - Grep
     - Bash
   ---
   ```
3. Agent must be self-contained — it runs in a forked context

## Shared Code

`shared/` contains utilities sourced by all hooks:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `constants.sh` | Version, file names, size limits, trust thresholds, Bayesian priors, IG lookup table |
| `metrics.sh` | `acquire_lock()`, `release_lock()`, `log_metric()` |
| `sanitize.sh` | `sanitize_path()`, `validate_json()`, `sanitize_for_log()` |
| `scripts/diff-analyzer.py` | V1 deep: unified diff analysis with hunk classification |
| `scripts/trust-model.py` | V2 batch: trust recalculation and distribution report |
| `scripts/session-report.py` | V4 report: formatted session dashboard |
| `scripts/learnings.py` | V6: Exponential Strategy Averaging — cross-session EMA accumulation |

Hooks resolve shared code via:
```bash
SHARED_DIR="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../shared"
```

## Submitting

1. `shellcheck -x` passes on all `.sh` files
2. `tests/run-all.sh` exits 0
3. No banned patterns (`flock`, `jq -s` on unbounded files, `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` as cache key)
4. Every SKILL.md has `allowed-tools` frontmatter
5. Every agent has `model`, `context: fork`, and `allowed-tools`
6. New hooks have corresponding tests
